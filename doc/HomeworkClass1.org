* Class 1 Exercises
** Blink variations
  1. Upload the Blink Example to your board (Examples → 01.Basics)
  2. Save the pin number (13) in an “int” variable and replace all
     instances of “13” with the variable. e.g. int ledPin=13;
  3. Modify the program to generate the SOS signal – 3 short, 3 long,
     3 short, pause, then repeat.
  4. Save the program as BlinkSOS and commit using github client
  5. Revise the program to add 2 function, shortBlinks() and
     longBlinks(), to generate the SOS signal to make the program
     shorter and more readable.
  6. Save the program again and commit using github client
  7. Revise the program to use one function instead of two (combine
     shortBlinks() and longBlinks() into one).
  8. Save the program again.
  9. Using github client:
     1. Commit
     2. Synchronize to github server.

** Accelerometer Exercise
   1. Load the MicroM example “impact”: Files →libraries → microM → impact 
   2. Open the Serial Monitor: Tools → Serial Monitor (or click on
      icon on top right)
   3. Run program, then tap the board lightly from different
      directions to see the delta values change
   4. Save the program into your sketches
   5. Modify the program to print the x, y, and z axis readings (not
      the delta readings).  This will cause a lot of information to show to 
      the screen.
   6. Turn the board in different directions and observe the readings.
