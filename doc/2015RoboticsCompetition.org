#+TITLE: Robotics Merit Badge Class Competition:  Robotic Uranium Carry
#+AUTHOR: Maurice Ling
#+DATE: 2015-07-20
* Summary
  1. Transport radioactive uranium capsule from one reactor to another.
  2. Uranium capsule will take the form of a ping pong ball
  3. Begin and end with a human-controlled segment to load and unload
     the capsule.
  4. Carefully navigate a maze autonomously
* Terminology
  1. We shall refer to the humans participating in the competition as the /participant(s)/
     and the device as the /robot/.
  2. The /payload/ refers to the ping pong ball in the competition.

* Competition Specifications
** Hardware
   1. The robot may use multiple processors/boards.
** Programming
   1. The robot shall not be re-programmed while the robot is in the course.
   2. The source code for the robots must be available for judges to review
** Time for Completion
   1. The robot shall complete the course in maximum of 5 minutes.
   2. Bonus points shall be awarded for time achieved under 3 minutes.
** Payload
   1. The payload shall be a regulation (non-radioactive) ping pong ball with a diameter
      of 40mm
   2. The payload shall not be directly touched by the participant.
** Loading/Unloading
   1. The robot shall load and unload the payload onto an 3 inch high elevated platform
   2. Loading and unloading may be done using manual (human-directed or controlled
      mechanisms).
** Transport Course
   1. The transport course will be navigated autonomously by the robot.
   2. The payload shall remain with the robot during transport
   3. The participant shall not manually intervene while the robot is within
      the transport course.
   4. The robot shall not make contact with walls or objects within the 
      transport course.
* Documentation
  1. Designs must be documented in your Engineering Notebook.
  2. Include general logic for program
  3. Include mechanical design diagrams/sketches
  4. Designs shall be available for review by the judges prior to the competition
     
* Teamwork (optional)
  1. A scout may team up with another scout.  
  2. Team must be decided by the end of the 2nd class.
  3. Each member of the team must understand how the robot operates.

* Scoring
  1. Completion of each segment (Load, transport, Unload) shall be +20 points.
  2. Bonus Points
     1) Time Bonus
        - +10 for under 3 minutes
        - +20 for under 2 minutes
        - +30 for under 1 minute
     2) Up to +20 points for elegant and innovative design
  3. Point Deductions
     1) Each manual intervention by the participant during transport (-5)
     2) Each payload touch by the participant (-5)
